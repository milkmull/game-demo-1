# game-demo-1
A 2D platformer I have been working on. Haven't had a lot of time to update this recently. Will update this to improved version sometime soon.

Make sure to have pygame and pytmx installed in order to run.

Run the main.py file from command promt to start the game

Jump with space, move with arrows, press a to attack, hold q and press direction to switch forms.
